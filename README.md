## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm Helen Zheng!  

### About Myself  
* ⛹️‍♀️ I'm a recent Yale University graduate with a Master's in Statistics & Data Science (December 2024) and will be starting as a Machine Learning Engineer.  
* ⛷ Adventurous Solo Traveler who has explored many places alone: 🇮🇹 Italy, 🇸🇬 Singapore, 🇯🇵 Japan, ❄️ Alaska, 🏰 Disney, 🇫🇷 Paris, 🇪🇸 Spain, 🇵🇹 Portugal, 🇩🇪 Germany, 🇧🇪 Belgium, 🇳🇱 Netherlands.  
* 👩‍💻 I learned coding and built my first project in 2021. Inspired by my Uber internship and the satisfaction coding brings, I switched my major to Data Science. Through this process, I discovered a passion for recommendation systems and system design for machine learning.  
* 🍳 I have completed 40+ hours of cooking, baking, and pastry classes.

### Recent Projects  

* 🛠️ **Distributed Machine Learning Pipeline**  
  Designed and implemented a distributed machine learning pipeline using Go, gRPC, and Mutex for communication between GPU device servers and a coordinator server.  
  - **Gradient Synchronization:** Optimized with Ring AllReduce, reducing latency from 84ms to 3ms compared to Naive AllReduce.  
  - **ML Training:** Developed a pipeline with 12 functions (e.g., Connect GPU Coordinator, Forward Pass, Backward Pass) and trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model on the MNIST dataset, achieving 92.89% accuracy in 10 epochs (9.5 minutes).

* 🍋 **Deep Learning Project**  
  Built and trained a Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) model on two graph-structured datasets (Movie-Lens 100K & IMDB) using PyTorch and PyGeometric to predict viewers’ and actors’ preferences for movies (best model MSE: 0.825 ± 0.024).  
  [Project Report](https://github.com/Helenbzbz/Deep-Learning-Final-Project/blob/main/Deep_Learning_Final_Report_Helen_Zheng.pdf)  

* 🌰 **Traffic Monitoring Project**  
  Developed a Traffic Monitor computer vision model capable of labeling seven traffic objects by employing Transfer Learning with TensorFlow's EfficientNetB0 and tuning hyperparameters for dense, batch normalization, and dropout layers using Keras.
